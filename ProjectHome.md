this is a toy file system implemented when I learned how to structure data on raw device with the file concept. this file system is very simple. Firstly there are about 1000+ lines C code. secondly just support create/delete file, rm/mk directory and hard link. Lastly this size of file system is 145\*512 bytes; max number of file and directory in all is 16; and max size of each file is 8\*512 bytes.
